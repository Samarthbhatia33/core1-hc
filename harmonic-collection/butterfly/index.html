            The butterfly effect rests on the notion that the world is deeply interconnected, 
            such that one small occurrence can influence a much larger complex system. The effect 
            is named after an allegory for chaos theory; it evokes the idea that a small butterfly 
            flapping its wings could, hypothetically, cause a typhoon.

        <p class="intro">
            The world is vast and complex and it may sometimes seem that our small decisions and 
            actions have little to no impact on the big picture. However, if you think about minute 
            details of your life, you may be able to see how a small event was actually the catalyst 
            for a huge change in your life. For example, maybe you bumped into someone at a coffee shop 
            that happens to work at your dream company and eventually got you an interview there. What 
            if you had chosen a different coffee shop, or been there five minutes later? You may not 
            have met the person that got you into your dream job. The idea that something small, like 
            getting coffee, can have much larger effects, such as altering your career is called the butterfly effect.
