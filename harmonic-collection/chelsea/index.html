    <p class="chelsea-title"> The Chelsea Galleries</p>

    <p class="para-1">
        I started on The High Line in Chelsea Market to visit a variety of galleries between 20th and 24th street. I had
        not previously visited the exhibitions in the area before and I had no idea what to expect! Throughout the trip,
        I came across various pieces of media: oil paintings, small and large sculptures, fabrics and digital prints.
        Witnessing such variety in mediums, concepts and executions in a short amount of time was inspiring in itself.
        As it reminded me of the endless boundaries in the world of art and design. I find that the style of the
        artworks below is extremely dynamic and expressive. I am not usually attracted to still life studies or
        paintings of flowers, however, the two paintings (top left) caught my attention because of the vivid imagery it
        created in my head. The first has themes of richness and elegance with its use of bold red, blend of textiles
        and the negative space in the middle of the composition through the flowers. Whereas the one to the right is
        ominous, moody and almost repulsive with its dull and dying flowers.

        I was taken aback by the scale and visual impact of this exhibition. It was a surreal feeling to be in a large
        hall, constructed out of monochrome colours, with gigantic, organically shapes boulders and large blocks of wood
        cut in geometric shapes. Walking past and through these installations, it felt like a unity between all times:
        of past, present and future. From the juxtaposition of the sleekly crafted panels of wood with literal pieces of
        nature. I felt as if I was no longer at an exhibition during the day, or with my class for a field trip, but
        simply absorbing a space and a new landscape that was so radical from anything else around me. </p>

        The exhibit above created a dreamlike environment through the use of negative space and an interplay between
        bold and fragile colors and forms. Contrasting the exhibit above, it was the formlessness of the paintings and
        the room, that evoked a response within me. Ideas of surrender, fragility, time and nothingness came to my mind.

        These detailed, individual pieces of media and artwork, came together to create a holistic montage over two
        walls. What fascinates me about this exhibit is the stylistic differences between all the frames, and yet if
        they are all assembled together, it creates an optical experience for the viewer. I first zoomed out and stood
        at the edge of the room to capture the shades of color, and as I walked up closer to the works, I was greeted
        with incredibly unique aesthetics and detailed pieces of art. </p>
