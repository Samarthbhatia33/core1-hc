        Since the halloween spirit is already rising in the city,
    </p> 

    <p class="thought">
        I thought it would be cool to talk about my process of drawing the Skeleton Man.
    </p>
    <p class="numbar">
        However, as you go through this page, you will find I found myself much more fascinated by formatting and placing text.  
    </p>

    <p class="para-1">
        We had one class to complete a study of the skeleton from the angle our desks were placed in and I had a side
        profile view of the subject. Understanding and creating the folds of the fabric was especially tricky for me and
        through the sketch I focused a lot on getting the movement of the cloth right.
    </p>

    <p class="para-2">
        I began by making a simple line drawing of the skeleton. I decided to make a composition completely out of
        random shapes and lines after trying to make the subject entirely out of shapes and then using pathfinder, as
        joining and deleting shapes was not accurate to how I wanted to portray the skeleton.
    </p>

    <p class="para-3">
        After locking the drawing, I experimented with placing patterns in new shapes on top based on the contours of
        the fabric and bones. After I was satisfied with the placement of the pattern, I locked it and added more
        patterns/ grey scale colours on top to give it an additional depth.
    </p>

    <p class="para-4">
        This is the point where my composition started to have a certain aesthetic and when it began to come together. I
        did not want to use the colours and the patterns conservatively and that created the challenge of balancing a
        lot of elements which could very easily blend in together and create an image that is not easy to follow. But as
        I continued to switch around between different colours and patterns across the pattern man, I began to create a
        distinguishable yet dynamic pattern man.
    </p>

    <p class="para-5">
        It was also important to me to give empty space to the composition and I achieved this by giving a solid colour
        blocking to certain areas of the subject. For example, the skull and the bones, the dark area behind and on the
        strap across the chest. On the fabric, I wanted to experiment with different layering, and that is why some
        areas only have one pattern directly on the background, only colour, patterns on top of patterns and patterns on
        top of colours.
        With the coloured pattern man, I continued the theme of a very busy, visually stimulating composition. I
        enhanced these factors by using six, bold colours for the patterns: orange, green, blue, red, yellow and blue. I
        added patterns in the shapes on the face of the skeleton as well as solid, loud colours like yellow and blue in
        blocks to to make it grasping. This was far beyond my comfort levels and I would have much rather focused on
        creating a more visually relaxed composition, but with this assignment I wanted to see how far I could take all
        the elements to create something wild, yet interesting. I followed a similar approach to creating the background
        as I did for the black and white â€“ by creating a layer with a dim shade from the colour palette, and adding one
        of seven shapes with a low opacity to enhance the tone of the piece.
