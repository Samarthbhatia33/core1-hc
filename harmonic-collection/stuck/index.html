    Stuckist Manifesto
</p>

<p class="one">
1. Stuckism is the quest for authenticity.
</p>

<p class="two">
   2. Painting is the medium of self-discovery. It engages the person fully with a process of action, emotion, thought and vision, revealing all of these with intimate and unforgiving breadth and detail.
</p>
<p class="three"> 
    3. Stuckism proposes a model of art which is holistic. It is a meeting of the conscious and unconscious, thought and emotion, spiritual and material, private and public. Modernism is a school of fragmentation — one aspect of art is isolated and exaggerated to detriment of the whole.
</p>
<p class="four"> 
   4. Artists who don’t paint aren’t artists.
</p>
<p class="five"> 
   5. Art that has to be in a gallery to be art isn’t art.
</p>

<p class="six"> 
   6. The Stuckist paints pictures because painting pictures is what matters.
</p>

<p class="seven"> 
    7. The Stuckist is not mesmerised by the glittering prizes, but is wholeheartedly engaged in the process of painting. Success to the Stuckist is to get out of bed in the morning and paint..
</p>

<p class="eight"> 
   8.  It is the Stuckist’s duty to explore his/her neurosis and innocence through the making of paintings and displaying them in public, thereby enriching society by giving shared form to individual experience and an individual form to shared experience.
</p>

<p class="nine"> 
    9.  The Stuckist is not a career artist but rather an amateur (amare, Latin, to love) who takes risks on the canvas rather than hiding behind ready-made objects (e.g. a dead sheep). The amateur, far from being second to the professional, is at the forefront of experimentation, unencumbered by the need to be seen as infallible. Leaps of human endeavour are made by the intrepid individual, because he/she does not have to protect their status. Unlike the professional, the Stuckist is not afraid to fail.

 <p class="ten"> 
    10.  Painting is mysterious. It creates worlds within worlds, giving access to the unseen psychological realities that we inhabit.
