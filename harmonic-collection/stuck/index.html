Stuckism is the quest for authenticity. By removing the mask of cleverness and admitting where we are, the Stuckist allows him/herself uncensored expression.

<p class="two">
    Painting is the medium of self-discovery. It engages the person fully with a process of action, emotion, thought and vision, revealing all of these with intimate and unforgiving breadth and detail.

<p class="three"> 
    Stuckism proposes a model of art which is holistic. It is a meeting of the conscious and unconscious, thought and emotion, spiritual and material, private and public. Modernism is a school of fragmentation — one aspect of art is isolated and exaggerated to detriment of the whole. This is a fundamental distortion of the human experience and perpetrates an egocentric lie.

<p class="four"> 
    Artists who don’t paint aren’t artists.
</p>
<p class="five"> 
    Art that has to be in a gallery to be art isn’t art.
</p>

<p class="six"> 
    The Stuckist paints pictures because painting pictures is what matters.
